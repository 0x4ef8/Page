## Steps to Automate  

### 1. **Create a Facebook Page**  
Start by creating a Facebook page that you want to manage through automation. This page will serve as the destination for your automated posts.  

### 2. **Create a Facebook App**  
To generate the access token required for automation, follow these steps:  
- Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) and click **Create App**.  
- Select the **"Business"** app type and click **Next**.  
- Assign an **App Name** and provide an **Email Address**.  
- Once the app is created, youâ€™ll receive an **App ID** (e.g., `1008`) visible on the dashboard.

### 3. **Generate an Access Token**  
The access token is needed to allow the app to interact with the Facebook page.  
- Open the [Facebook Graph Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).  
- Select the app you just created from the dropdown menu.  
- Under the **User or Page** section, choose **Get Page Access Token**.  
- Select the page you want to automate, and the page access token will be generated.  

> **Note:** Ensure you select the page access token instead of the user token for automation purposes.

### 4. **Set Permissions**  
Facebook requires specific permissions to allow the app to post on your behalf:  
1. Search for the `pages_manage_posts` permission.  
2. Select it and click on **Generate Access Token**.  
3. Log in with your Facebook account, and the token will be updated with the required permissions.  

Now, copy the token and head to the [Access Token Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/). Paste the token there to view its details, such as assigned permissions and expiry date.

### 5. **Extend Token Validity**  
The default access token is short-lived. To ensure automation runs smoothly, extend it to a non-expiring token:  
1. Generate a **long-lived token** using the **Extend Access Token** button in the debugger.  
2. Use the following URL to convert it into a non-expiring page token:
